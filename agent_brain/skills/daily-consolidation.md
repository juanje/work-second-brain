# Skill: Daily consolidation

## When to use

Triggered by the user via the `/daily` command, typically at the end of the
work day or start of the next. This is the "sleep" cycle — where the system
consolidates the day's work and learns from it.

## Procedure

---

### Step 0: Reflect first

Before consolidating, always process the current conversation:

1. Read `agent_brain/skills/process-conversation.md` and execute it.
   This captures the current conversation into today's log and detects
   observations — even if the user already ran `/reflect` earlier.
   The reflect skill appends without duplicating, so running it twice
   is safe.

This ensures no conversation context is lost, even if the user forgot
to `/reflect` during the day.

---

The daily consolidation has two parts: first consolidate (summarize and
organize the day), then learn (create knowledge, form connections, act on
mature observations).

---

### Part 1: Consolidate

#### 1. Replay the day

Read `logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today's date). The log now contains the reflect
pass from Step 0, plus any earlier `/reflect` passes from other
conversations today. Read it as a whole — understand the day's arc, not
isolated conversations.

If no log exists for today, check yesterday's. If neither exists, note it
and skip to Part 2 (the observation journal may still have actionable items).

#### 2. Day summary

Add a summary section at the top of the daily log (after the frontmatter),
or update it if one already exists:

```markdown
## Day summary
- **Key themes:** [2-3 main topics or threads of the day]
- **Moved forward:** [what progressed]
- **Learned:** [new knowledge acquired, if any]
- **Open:** [unresolved threads to pick up tomorrow]
```

Keep it brief — this makes the weekly review's job easier.

#### 3. Board snapshot

Read `work/BOARD.md`. Quick checks only:
- Is Doing clean for tomorrow? Anything that should move to Done or back
  to Next Actions?
- Any items that need attention flagged during the day?
- Don't do a full board hygiene pass — that's for `/weekly` and `/monthly`.

---

### Part 2: Learn

#### 4. Create new concepts

Review the day's log (especially the Lessons, Decisions, and System
observations sections). Look for knowledge worth retaining:

- Patterns that apply beyond the specific situation discussed.
- Lessons that would be useful if the same situation arises again.
- Principles or heuristics the user articulated.

For each, check if it's already captured in `agent_brain/concepts/` or
`agent_brain/projects/`. If not, create a new file:

```
agent_brain/concepts/short-descriptive-name.md
```

With standard frontmatter and enough context to be useful without the
original conversation. Link to the daily log as source.

#### 5. Form associations

Look for connections between today's work and existing brain files:

- Does a concept discussed today relate to an existing concept?
- Did a project decision connect to a known pattern?
- Is there a link between an idea and a lesson learned?

For each meaningful connection, add cross-references to **both** files. Make links
**semantically explicit** so the reader can decide whether to follow them:

```markdown
> Related: [other-file](path/to/other-file.md) — brief explanation of
> how they connect and what is on the other side (general pattern,
> deeper explanation, source conversation, practical example, etc.).
```

These associations are the "synapses" of the system. They strengthen with
use across days and help surface relevant context in future sessions.

When you create or significantly extend a **concept or project file**, actively ask:

- "Which 1-2 existing files does this build on, clarify, or exemplify?"
- "From this file, what is the **most useful next hop** a future reader might want?"

Add links for those top candidates rather than trying to link everything.

Don't force connections. If nothing connects naturally today, skip this step.

#### 6. Act on mature observations

Read `agent_brain/observations.md`. For each observation with **2 or more
occurrences** (seen across different conversations or days):

**Skill candidates (seen 2+):**
1. Create the skill in `agent_brain/skills/verb-object.md`.
2. Include: frontmatter, "When to use" with clear triggers, "Procedure"
   with numbered steps.
3. Add it to the Skills section of AGENTS.md with a trigger description.
4. Mark the observation as resolved in the journal.

**Rule candidates (seen 2+):**
1. Present the proposed rule to the user for approval.
2. If approved: add it to the Rules section of AGENTS.md.
3. Mark the observation as resolved in the journal.
4. If not approved: leave it in the journal, note the rejection.

**Concept candidates (seen 2+):**
1. Create the concept file if not already created in step 4 above.
2. Mark the observation as resolved in the journal.

**Structure candidates (seen 2+):**
1. Propose the new directory to the user.
2. If approved: create it, move relevant files, update "Where to find
   things" in AGENTS.md.
3. Mark the observation as resolved.

Observations with only 1 occurrence stay in the journal — they need more
data before acting.

#### 7. Update Active context

Active context has two subsections: **Right now** (ephemeral state) and
**Files** (pointers to semantic memory).

**### Right now** — current state the agent should know at every session
start, without opening any file. Volatile facts that change every few days:

- Current situation (sprint phase, deadline week, on-call, travel)
- Most immediate next actions (1-3 items, with dates if known)
- Blockers or waiting items affecting daily work
- Constraints (meetings, PTO, reduced availability)

Keep it to 3-5 bullet points. This is the scratchpad of working memory —
not a task list, not a log. Replace the full contents each time; don't
append.

**### Files** — pointers to brain files worth keeping in the agent's
peripheral awareness. Updated based on today's activity:

1. Scan files in `agent_brain/` (excluding `identity/`, `skills/`, `archive/`).
2. Read metadata (`access_count`, `last_accessed`) as the starting point —
   frequently read and recently accessed files are the primary candidates.
3. Adjust with judgment: a file accessed once today on an important topic
   may deserve promotion; a frequently-touched housekeeping file may not.
4. Keep 5-7 entries. Remove files no longer actively relevant; add newly
   important ones.
5. The Board link is always present — don't remove it.

Each file entry has two layers — **hot data** inline and a **read trigger**:

```
- [Short name](path/to/file.md) — key fact or core principle (useful
  without opening the file). Read when [clear trigger for when to open it].
```

Examples:
- `[Board](work/BOARD.md) — task management and priorities. Read when planning, triaging, or checking what to work on next.`
- `[Project X](path) — blocked on API approval. Read when discussing project X or planning sprints.`

Avoid: accumulated history, internal scores, operational detail that only
matters during maintenance.

### Finalize

#### 8. Git commit

```bash
git add AGENTS.md agent_brain/ logs/ work/BOARD.md && git commit -m "daily: YYYY-MM-DD" 2>/dev/null || true
```
