# Skill: Weekly review

## When to use

Triggered by the `/weekly` command — either by the user manually or by the
automated cron job (Sundays at 23:55). Also triggered when the user says
"weekly review", "what did I do this week", "end of week", or for broader
reviews ("what have I done this quarter", "review for my manager").

**Autonomous mode (cron):** All steps run without user interaction. Act with
judgment; log all decisions and changes made. No approval gates — the
maintenance cycles and git history provide the correction mechanism.

## Procedure

### 0. Check prerequisite cycles

Before starting the weekly review:

1. **Reflect:** Run the reflect procedure first (read and execute
   `agent_brain/skills/process-conversation.md`) to capture the current
   conversation.
2. **Daily:** Check if `/daily` was run in the last 2 days. Look for a
   "Day summary" section in recent logs. If `/daily` hasn't been run
   recently, inform the user: "Daily consolidation hasn't been run in
   the last couple of days. I'll run a quick consolidation now to make
   sure this review has complete data." Then execute the daily
   consolidation procedure (skip Step 0 since reflect was already done
   above).

### 1. Gather data

- Read logs from `logs/` for the current week.
- Read `user/` to understand current state of the user's workspace.

### 2. Present the weekly summary

**Completed this week:**
- Items completed or resolved, based on logs and `user/` content.

**Still in progress:**
- Ongoing items. On track or at risk?

**Waiting/Blocked:**
- Anything the user is waiting on.

**Decisions and context** (from logs):
- Key decisions made and their reasoning.
- Lessons learned.

**Unplanned work:**
- Things that came up during the week that weren't planned.

### 3. Review user workspace

Walk through `user/` content:
- Any completed items that can be archived or removed?
- Any stale items that need attention?
- Is the structure still serving the user well, or does it need adjustment?
- Any items that should be prioritized for next week?

### 3b. Review ideas

- Read `agent_brain/ideas/_scratchpad.md` — any items worth promoting to their own file?
- Scan idea files in `agent_brain/ideas/`:
  - `seed` ideas: still interesting? Promote to `developing` or archive.
  - `developing` ideas: any progress this week? Anything to add from the week's context?
  - `ready` ideas: should any be converted this week? (create project, start task, etc.)
- Present a brief ideas summary to the user alongside the workspace review.

### 3c. Link hygiene (weekly pass)

As you scan concepts and projects this week, look for **missed functional
links** — places where a reader would genuinely benefit from a pointer to
another file:

- New files that **extend, clarify, or provide examples** for older ones but
  are not linked yet — and where the reader of the older file would benefit
  from knowing about the new one.
- Older files that mention concepts now fleshed out elsewhere — where a link
  would help the reader navigate to deeper content.

Add a link only if it serves the reader of that specific file. Don't add
links to maintain bidirectional relationships — a concept's importance is
shown by how many files naturally link to it through use, not by enforced
backlinks. Don't cap the number of links; every genuinely functional link
should exist.

### 4. Calibrate promotions (Hebbian)

Review visibility levels across the full knowledge base. The weekly cycle
looks at the whole gradient, not just Active context. Promotion and demotion
are gradual — one level at a time (see daily-consolidation Step 7 for the
level table).

1. **Active context (level 4):** for each file, check `access_count` growth
   this week.
   - Grew across multiple days → **reinforce** (keep, enrich description).
   - Didn't grow → **demote one level**: move to "Where to find things"
     (level 3) if the file still has periodic relevance, or back to its
     directory index (level 1-2) if the spike is clearly over.
2. **"Where to find things" (level 3):** check entries that were added
   beyond the base set (user workspace, projects, concepts, ideas, journal,
   observations are base). Any added entry whose underlying files haven't
   been accessed this week → demote back to directory index (level 1-2).
3. **Directory indexes (level 1-2):** scan `index.md` files for entries
   whose underlying file hasn't been accessed in >21 days → flag for
   potential demotion within the index. Don't act automatically — flag.
4. **New promotions:** scan files accessed repeatedly across different days
   this week. Promote **one level up** from current position, not directly
   to Active context. Only files already at level 3 that continue to be
   accessed in most sessions graduate to level 4.
5. **Missing indexes:** if a promoted file has no index pathway (standalone,
   no parent `index.md`) → flag the missing index as a structure candidate.

Also update the **Right now** subsection with current state. See the daily
skill Step 7 for format and full guidance on both subsections.

Present changes across all levels: "Level 4: kept [X], demoted [Y].
Level 3: added [A], removed [B]. Level 1-2: enriched [C], flagged [D]."

### 4b. Identity file check

If `agent_brain/identity/USER.md` has grown significantly (rough threshold:
80+ lines of content), consider splitting detailed sections into separate
files under `agent_brain/identity/` (e.g., `background.md`, `health.md`).
Keep `USER.md` lean — identity, current context, and preferences. Each
extension should have explicit load conditions at the top:
`Load when discussing [topic]`. Link from `USER.md` with:
`[Label](filename.md) — load when [trigger]`.

Also check `USER.md` for new facts from this week's logs that should be
added (new projects, changes in routine, people mentioned, context shifts).

**Episodic entries:** For time-bounded situations (illness, injury, travel,
temporary care load), collapse the accumulated day-by-day history to a
single summary line once the episode is clearly resolved or stable. Format:
`[Topic] (dates): [one-sentence outcome]. Detail in journal.`
The day-by-day detail lives in the journal entries — `USER.md` only needs
the current state and a pointer. Don't wait for the file to grow large;
collapse when the episode closes.

**Extension file candidates (people, domains):** When a person or topic
appears repeatedly across conversations and requires structured background
context beyond a one-liner, consider creating an extension file under
`agent_brain/identity/` (e.g., `background.md`, `health.md`, `family.md`,
`work.md`). The criterion is not file size — it's whether there is enough
*stable, structured reference material* that an agent would genuinely need
when the topic appears. Three questions:
1. Is there a clear load trigger? ("when discussing X in depth")
2. Is the content reference material (stable facts, dynamics, history) —
   not episodic history that belongs in the journal?
3. Does it appear in multiple conversations, making the file worth
   maintaining?

If yes to all three, propose the split to the user. Track candidates in
`agent_brain/observations.md` under "Structure candidates" until they
mature. Flag to the user before splitting — they should approve the
structure.

### 5. Calibrate learned skills and rules

Review **learned** skills and rules (created by the agent during `/daily`,
not core system skills) that were created or modified this week:

- **Used and referenced** this week → keep as-is, or adjust if usage revealed
  issues with triggers or procedure.
- **Not used at all** since creation → flag. The trigger description may be
  too vague, or the skill may have been premature. Don't remove yet — give
  it another week. Premature pruning loses the signal; the monthly cycle
  handles archiving after longer disuse.

### 6. Generalize

Look across the week's specific concepts, skills, and brain files for patterns
that can be abstracted into general knowledge.

1. Scan `agent_brain/concepts/` and `agent_brain/projects/` for files that
   share a common theme or pattern.
2. If 2-3+ specific items (A, B, C) are related and share an underlying
   principle:
   - Create a general concept file (AA) that captures the shared pattern.
   - In AA, explain the general principle and link to the specific instances:
     ```markdown
     ## Specific instances
     - [A](path/to/A.md) — how A relates to this pattern
     - [B](path/to/B.md) — how B relates to this pattern
     - [C](path/to/C.md) — how C relates to this pattern
     ```
   - For each specific file (A, B, C), consider whether a link to the
     general pattern (AA) would **serve the reader** of that file. Add it
     only if knowing about the broader principle genuinely deepens the
     reader's understanding of the specific concept. Don't add back-
     references just for graph completeness.
   - If AA is heavily relevant right now, add it to Active context in
     AGENTS.md. The general version is more broadly useful than any
     specific instance.
3. Do the same for skills: if skills X and Y follow a similar procedure for
   different domains, consider a general skill that covers both.
4. Create generalizations with judgment. Log the reasoning and what was created.
5. **Consider form, not just content.** Is the generalization actionable —
   does it guide future decisions? If so, write it as a framework: when to
   apply, how to decide, what to watch for. A concept that only describes a
   pattern is knowledge; a concept that guides judgment is an attractor.

Don't force generalizations. If nothing connects naturally across the week,
skip this step. Generalization emerges from accumulated data, not from a
single week.

5. **Structural clustering** (applies to all brain structures, not just
   concepts): scan directories for files sharing a prefix or referencing
   each other heavily. If 3+ files form a cluster → propose consolidation
   into a subdirectory with an `index.md` hub. See Core Behavior rule 6.

### 7. Light pruning (flag only)

Scan brain files for staleness signals:
- Files not accessed in >21 days → log them in the weekly maintenance note.
  Don't move them — that's the monthly cycle's job.
- If any flagged files are in Active context → remove them from Active
  context (they shouldn't be there if untouched for 3 weeks).

### 8. Prepare next week

- Review current `user/` content and recent logs.
- Write a brief priorities summary to the weekly log: top 3-5 items for
  next week based on urgency, dependencies, and open threads. No interaction
  needed — the summary is there for the user to read.

### 9. Write weekly summary to journal

Write a summary of the week to `user/journal/weekly/YYYY-WNN.md` (create the file). Include: what was completed, key decisions, metrics if available (tickets resolved, MRs), and themes. This is a user artifact for future reference — not a log, not agent memory.

### 10. Git commit

```bash
git add AGENTS.md agent_brain/ logs/ user/ && git commit -m "weekly: YYYY-WNN" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 11. Broader review mode

If the user asks for a monthly or quarterly review:

- Scan journal files in `user/journal/` for the period (weekly, monthly as needed).
- Scan logs in `logs/` for the period.
- Group by project or theme.
- Highlight: major deliverables, contributions, problems solved, skills developed.
- Present in a format suitable for sharing or personal reflection.
