# Skill: Monthly maintenance

## When to use

Triggered by the user via the `/monthly` command, typically at the end of the
month or when the system feels cluttered. This is the deepest maintenance
cycle — focused on forgetting what's abandoned, deep generalization across the
full knowledge base, and structural cleanup.

Lighter maintenance happens at other levels:
- `/daily` — concept creation, associations, initial promotion, skill/rule
  creation from mature observations.
- `/weekly` — Hebbian calibration of promotions, generalization across the
  week, light pruning flags.

This cycle handles what only makes sense at monthly scale.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Check prerequisite cycles

Before deep maintenance, ensure lower-level cycles are current:

1. **Reflect:** Run the reflect procedure first (read and execute
   `agent_brain/skills/process-conversation.md`).
2. **Weekly:** Check if `/weekly` was run in the last 10 days. Look for
   recent review files in `agent_brain/reviews/`. If not, inform the
   user: "Weekly review hasn't been run recently. Running a weekly cycle
   first to ensure the monthly has complete data." Then execute the
   weekly review procedure (which will cascade into daily/reflect as
   needed).

---

Execute remaining phases in order. Each phase is independent: if one
fails, log the error and continue with the next.

---

### Phase 1: Log compaction

**Goal:** Keep `logs/` manageable while preserving valuable context.

1. List files in `logs/` older than 30 days (exclude maintenance logs).
2. For each old log:
   - Check if its key content (decisions, lessons) has been extracted to
     `agent_brain/`.
   - If fully extracted: move to `logs/archive/`.
   - If it contains unextracted knowledge: extract it to the appropriate
     `agent_brain/` location first, then archive the log.
3. Never delete logs outright — always archive.
4. Record what was compacted.

---

### Phase 2: Full pruning (archive)

**Goal:** Move truly abandoned information out of the active space. This is
the "forgetting" that the weekly cycle only flags.

1. Scan all files in `agent_brain/` subdirectories (excluding `identity/`,
   `skills/`, and `archive/`).
2. Read their metadata (`last_accessed`, `access_count`).
3. If a file hasn't been accessed in >30 days AND has fewer than 5 total
   accesses:
   - Move it to `agent_brain/archive/`.
   - If it was linked in Active context of AGENTS.md, remove the link.
   - If other files reference it, update cross-references to point to the
     archive location.
   - Record the move.
4. If a file hasn't been accessed in >30 days BUT has >5 accesses:
   - Don't move it. Flag it as a review candidate in the maintenance log.
     It was important once — the user should decide.

**Exception:** Never move or prune files in `agent_brain/identity/`,
`agent_brain/skills/`, or `work/`. Those require human decision.

---

### Phase 3: Prune unused learned skills and rules

**Goal:** Review skills and rules that were created by the agent through use,
and weaken or archive those that haven't been confirmed by continued use.

Skills fall into two categories:

**Core skills** (never pruned — they are the system's architecture):
`process-conversation.md`, `daily-consolidation.md`, `weekly-review.md`,
`monthly-maintenance.md`, `run-standup.md`, `capture-item.md`,
`next-task.md`, `sync-board.md`.

**Learned skills** (subject to Hebbian pruning — everything else):
Skills created by the agent during `/daily` consolidation based on
observed patterns. These earned their place through repeated use, and
they keep it the same way.

**Procedure:**

1. Review all learned skills in `agent_brain/skills/` (skip core skills).
2. For each learned skill, check if it was referenced or triggered in the
   last month's logs.
   - Referenced and used → keep.
   - Not referenced but less than 1 month old → keep (still new).
   - Not referenced and 1-3 months old → **archive**. Move to
     `agent_brain/archive/`, remove from Skills section of AGENTS.md.
     Ask the user: "This skill hasn't been used in a month. Is it
     seasonal (needed at specific times, like sprint planning or
     quarterly releases), or should I archive it?"
     If the user says seasonal → keep it, add a `seasonal: true` note
     in its frontmatter.
   - Archived and not retrieved in >3 months → can be deleted. Git
     history preserves it if ever needed again.
3. Review rules in AGENTS.md: any added by the agent (not original rules)
   that seem to conflict with observed behavior or are consistently
   ignored?
   - Flag for review. Present to the user.

---

### Phase 4: Deep generalization

**Goal:** Find patterns across the full knowledge base that haven't been
caught by weekly generalization. This operates at a broader scale — looking
across weeks and months of accumulated knowledge.

1. Scan all concept files in `agent_brain/concepts/`.
2. Look for clusters of related concepts that share an underlying principle
   but haven't been linked or generalized yet.
3. If 2-3+ specific concepts (A, B, C) share a pattern:
   - Create a general concept file (AA) that captures the shared principle.
   - In AA, link to the specific instances with explanations:
     ```markdown
     ## Specific instances
     - [A](path/to/A.md) — how A relates
     - [B](path/to/B.md) — how B relates
     - [C](path/to/C.md) — how C relates
     ```
   - In each specific file, add a back-reference:
     ```markdown
     > General pattern: [AA](path/to/AA.md) — the broader principle
     ```
   - If the general concept is broadly useful, add it to Active context.
4. Do the same for skills: if multiple skills follow a similar pattern for
   different domains, consider creating a general skill that covers the
   common procedure, referencing the specific skills for domain details.
5. Check existing generalizations: are they still accurate? Do they need
   updating based on new specific instances?
6. Apply the same generalization logic to **all brain structures** — not
   just concepts. Projects, teams, and any other directories can also
   contain related files that share an underlying pattern.
7. Present all generalizations to the user for approval before creating.

### Phase 5: Ideas review

**Goal:** Keep `agent_brain/ideas/` healthy.

1. Read `agent_brain/ideas/_scratchpad.md`.
   - Any item older than 7 days? Flag it: promote to its own file or remove.
2. Scan all idea files in `agent_brain/ideas/` (excluding `_scratchpad.md`).
3. For each idea:
   - `seed` not accessed in >14 days → flag as stale.
   - `developing` not accessed in >21 days → flag as stuck.
   - `ready` not accessed in >7 days → flag for action.
   - `converted` or `archived` older than 30 days → move to
     `agent_brain/archive/`.
4. Record findings.

---

### Phase 6: Contradiction detection

**Goal:** Maintain coherence in the knowledge base.

1. Scan concept and project files for contradictions: information in one
   file that conflicts with information in another.
2. Check recent logs (last month) for information that contradicts existing
   brain files.
3. For each contradiction:
   - Clear contradiction + reliable new info → update the old file.
   - Ambiguous → add a note:
     ```
     > ⚠️ CONTRADICTION (YYYY-MM-DD): [description]. Pending human review.
     ```
4. Record contradictions found and how they were resolved.

---

### Phase 7: Structure review

**Goal:** Ensure `agent_brain/` structure matches how the system is actually
used. The directory structure should emerge from use, not from upfront design.

1. Review structure candidates in `agent_brain/observations.md`.
2. Scan files in `agent_brain/` — are there files that don't fit their
   current directory?
3. **Cluster detection** (applies to ALL directories — projects, concepts,
   teams, etc.): scan for files sharing a common prefix or with heavy
   mutual cross-references. If 3+ files form a cluster within the same
   directory:
   - Propose consolidation into a subdirectory with an `index.md` hub.
   - If approved: create it, move files, update all cross-references
     (AGENTS.md, reviews, team files, etc.), update "Where to find things."
   - See Core Behavior rule 6.
4. If a new category has accumulated (3+ files of a similar type in an
   ill-fitting directory):
   - Propose a dedicated directory.
   - If approved: create it, move the files, update "Where to find things"
     in AGENTS.md.
5. Check existing directories: any empty or with only 1 file after >30 days?
   - The directory may be premature. Flag it.
6. Record structural changes and proposals.

---

### Phase 8: Clear resolved observations

**Goal:** Keep the observation journal clean.

1. Read `agent_brain/observations.md`.
2. Move all entries in the "Resolved" section that are older than 30 days
   out of the file (they've served their purpose).
3. Check remaining unresolved observations: any older than 60 days with
   only 1 occurrence? They're probably noise — remove them.
